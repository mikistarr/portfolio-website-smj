                            <h2> Interview Transcript </h2>
                            <p> Hey, you! Yeah you. So you're interested in learning more about me? Well, let's get
                                started! </p>
                            <p><b> Talk about your career path </b></p>
                            <p>I’m a multi-disciplined creative strategist and versatile generalist with over 10 years
                                experience in graphic design, 5 in digital marketing, and a lifetime of creative
                                writing.
                                Currently I’m winding down an aggressive timeline in CareerFoundry’s UX Bootcamp and
                                will be
                                starting my frontend web development specialization shortly.</p>

                            <p> Much of my career was spent in traditional print design until mass layoffs created an
                                opportunity for entrepreneurship which began my transition to digital marketing—web
                                design,
                                non-coding development, social media marketing, and copywriting, to be more specific. It
                                was an
                                unpaid invoice that returned me to the traditional workforce and the most exciting,
                                versatile,
                                and educational experience of my career. </p>

                            <p> Hired in the subordinate role of content creator and publisher, my manager resigned the
                                day
                                before I started and made her exodus in the middle of my would-be training, creating an
                                opportunity for me to do for my new company what I’d done for my clients—enhance their
                                digital
                                presence. </p>

                            <p> Within 6 months I had my first promotion and all of digital marketing was mine. That’s
                                when I
                                realized I love doing it all and the more knowledge I had in the digital marketing and
                                tech
                                world, the happier I would be in my career. </p>

                            <p><b> What single project or task would you consider your most significant career
                                    accomplishment to
                                    date? </b></p>
                            <p> A minor part of the aforementioned role was to send out an email a month. I agreed to
                                help my
                                team out by doing that after that job owner was laid off. Now this was something I had
                                no prior
                                experience with and was accomplished by duplicating old emails and updating the copy.
                            </p>

                            <p> Never content with mediocrity, I took this as a challenge—a self-assigned project and an
                                educational opportunity. I got financial approval from my VP to take an email
                                masterclass at
                                Digital Summit that summer and returned on that investment by researching and switching
                                our CRM,
                                saving my department over $10K a year while adopting a platform that allowed me to
                                easily create
                                my own automated workflows, segment communication, build out an API to connect our
                                database
                                allowing me access to our more than 50K leads and student population, create new email
                                journeys,
                                A/B and subject line test, just to name a few. </p>

                            <p>The outcome of this undertaking was the creation of an email strategy that actually
                                rendered
                                results. It created a 7% increase in our online enrollment, a 15-20% average open rate
                                that
                                helped improve connections between prospective students and admissions, while
                                contributing to a
                                25% compound annual growth rate for our team.</p>

                            <p> <b> What have you done professionally that is an experience you would not want to
                                    repeat? </b></p>
                            <p>I twice unwittingly accepted a role that promised diversity but, unfortunately, didn’t
                                deliver.
                                Though the circumstances were quite different, the results were pretty much the same.
                                Both
                                claimed to want me for my broad experience but in reality what was asked of me was truly
                                basic.
                                Both paid very well and used about 40-60% of my skills. Easy money—but oh so boring. I
                                want to
                                travel and be able to enjoy the superficial things in life, so a 6-digit salary is kinda
                                important but with an expectation of spending more than 90K hours of my lifetime
                                working,
                                enjoyment is a requisite. </p>

                            <p><b> Is it better to be perfect and late or good and on time? </b></p>
                            <p> I strive for perfection in everything that I do. Always. I’m constantly aiming to better
                                at
                                work, at play, in my personal life. I want my name to be synonymous with impeccable
                                quality.</p>

                            <p> So I strive for perfection at all times. </p>

                            <p> But I never achieve it because it doesn’t exist. So if my goal is to be perfect and
                                late, I’ll
                                never show up and who does that serve? To be good and on time benefits all involved. It
                                allows
                                for growth. It creates space for iterative improvements and baby steps toward that ever
                                elusive
                                perfection which, by its nature, generates continued advancement, be it in myself or in
                                a
                                product or service. </p>
