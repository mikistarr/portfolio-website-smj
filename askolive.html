                <h4> PROJECT BACKGROUND </h4>
                <p> Introducing Olive! But hold on, let’s take a step back. Allow me to introduce you to the source of
                    inspiration behind Olive. The initial idea for this web application originated from the project
                    brief I chose during my participation in the Immersion program within CareerFoundry’s UX Design
                    Bootcamp. This assignment tasked me with creating an inclusively designed, responsive web portal
                    (app). The primary goal was to offer comprehensive health and wellness information while also
                    providing users with a platform to store their medical records and appointments. </p>
                <blockquote> Allow health-conscious individuals to log in to a responsive health
                    and wellbeing portal to record their health and medical information,
                    and access general physical and mental wellbeing features. </blockquote>

                    <h4> HYPOTHESIS </h4>
                    <p> Before embarking on a solution, my first step was to comprehend the problem from the user’s
                        standpoint. After dedicating time to analyze competitors and gaining initial insights, I
                        formulated a hypothesis— </p>
                    <p> <b> "If an app provides personalized guidance tailored to the unique needs of each individual,
                            then it is more likely that they will maintain inspiration and motivation, ultimately
                            leading to positive results. I believe that incorporating AI capabilities will better
                            personalize, thereby enhancing the user experience." </b></p>
                </div>
                <div>
                    <h4> RESEARCH GOALS </h4>
                    <p> With my hypothesis established, I proceeded to try to answer the following questions: </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li> What motivates our users to want to lose weight? What barriers prevent them from getting or
                            staying motivated? </li>
                        <li> What type of support and tools do potential users desire to help keep them motivated to
                            meet and maintain their wellness goals? </li>
                        <li> What pain points do potential users face when using health and fitness apps to help meet
                            wellness goals? </li>
                    </ul>

            <div> <!-- Start container -->
                <h4> USER PERSONAS </h4>
                <p> To better comprehend my users’ viewpoints, I synthesized data from surveys and interviews. This
                    formed a comprehensive understanding of their identities, usage context, motivations, and
                    challenges. This resulted in the formation of a couple distinct personas, with the primary being—
                </p>
                <p> <b> Layla, the Ultimate Caregiver </b></p>
                <p> Layla, as the primary persona, accurately embodies the potential user demographic I am targeting.
                    Struggling with the challenges of excess weight, Layla regularly faces physical strain and fatigue.
                    Regrettably, her demanding caregiving obligations leave her with limited time to tend to her own
                    health, let alone dedicate herself to the task of researching effective solutions. This scenario is
                    reflective of a substantial portion of users who confront comparable time constraints due to their
                    caregiving responsibilities, which may encompass parenting, spouse care, or attending to elderly
                    parents. It is precisely these challenges that make Layla a compelling representative of my intended
                    demographic. </p>

                    Layla needs a way to create a healthier lifestyle to
                    improve overall health without the pressure of lengthy
                    workouts and food calorie tracking.
                    <br> <br>
                    We will know this to be true when we see an increase in
                    average calories burned and/or activities completed and
                    reduction in joint pain on a regular basis.

                <h4> INFORMATION ARCHITECTURE </h4>
                <p> Before delving into the design of my web portal, my first step was to grasp the crucial content that
                    required sharing. For the initial assessment, catering to both the user’s requirements and project
                    criteria, I prioritized four key features: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Dashboard </li>
                    <li> Medicine tracking </li>
                    <li> Fitness and meal tracking</li>
                    <li>Education </li>
                </ul>
                <p> These selections formed the basis for devising a well-founded user flow. Through a card sorting
                    activity involving anonymous volunteers, the flow was refined to better synchronize with real-world
                    user expectations. </p>

                <h4> PROTOTYPING</h4>
                <p> With a design mocked up it was time to move on to the testing phase. I used Adobe
                    XD to pull everything together and create my first functioning prototype. I created a test plan with
                    a simple goal of assessing the mobile prototype’s: </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Learnability </li>
                    <li> Efficiency </li>
                    <li> Elimination of pain points </li>
                </ul>
                <p> In addition to identifying usability friction points, some capabilities I wanted to confirm were:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> Medication logging </li>
                    <li> Accessing workout from scheduled wellness plan </li>
                    <li> Accessing education library </li>
                    <li> Satisfaction with offered features </li>

                <h4> BRANDING </h4>
                <p> After contemplating the emotions I wanted to evoke and ensure they harmonized with the purpose and
                    objectives of the application I settled on a primary color palette that leans towards bluish-green,
                    accompanied by a reddish-orange shade. </p>

                <p> To complete the visual aesthetic of the Ask Olive web portal, I formulated a series of UI guidelines
                    and documented them in a couple of references for future use.</p>

                <h4> MEET OLIVE! </h4>
                <p> Ask Olive has transformed into a comprehensive web portal application that seeks to leverage AI to
                    cater to the needs of individuals grappling with health and wellness challenges. Upon signing up and
                    completing a thorough questionnaire, users gain the opportunity to receive personalized meal and
                    fitness plans aligned with their specific requirements. The days of scrutinizing article credibility
                    for helpful advice are over. Users can simply ask Olive at any time, receiving not only answers but
                    responses tailored to their unique health conditions and insights from repeated interactions. </p>
                <p> The Ask Olive app facilitates medication management, enabling users to log their medication intake.
                    It also hosts a repository of health resources, encompassing articles, fitness videos, and
                    alternative meal plans. Moreover, it fosters community building by enabling users to connect with
                    friends within the app. </p>

                <h4> LEARNINGS </h4>
                <p> Throughout this process, I’ve gleaned a couple of lessons—and not just about the process itself:
                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li> A significant number of individuals feel neglected when attempting to enhance their fitness due
                        to the limited consideration given by most apps to those dealing with chronic illnesses or
                        conditions that present exercise challenges. It’s crucial to ensure they feel acknowledged and
                        to provide them a voice in their personal journey. This app is dedicated to fulfilling that
                        role. Consequently, obtaining continuous feedback from this specific demographic will play a
                        pivotal role in the app’s success. </li>
                    <li> I can’t profess a genuine concern for the well-being of those often overlooked without
                        integrating accessibility into design. I hadn’t previously considered factors like color
                        contrast, font size, or element spacing. Moving forward, I’ll incorporate these and many other
                        considerations into every phase of a project. </li>
                </ul>

                    <h4> CONCLUSION </h4>
                    <p> For many, meeting wellness goals can be challenging. It’s not merely a matter of calories in
                        versus calories out. Numerous factors, including genetics, physical condition, psychological
                        aspects, and learned behaviors, come into play. The average person often lacks the necessary
                        training and knowledge to navigate these complexities. Having access to an app capable of
                        swiftly accessing, analyzing, and providing guidance holds the potential to significantly
                        transform one’s life. That’s because better health starts with better health education.
